I like to code things from scratch, and enjoy bringing ideas to life in the browser. The life of a developer requires one to learn new things everyday, because technology keeps changing at a very fast pace. I have therefore, embraced the concept of being a life long learner and continue to learn new concepts and technologies in my free time.',
